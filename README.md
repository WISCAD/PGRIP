Included are our global routing solutions. They are verified using the ISPD08 and our internal scripts. The PGRIP solutions are obtained by running on the Computer-Aided Engineering grid at UW-Madison.

The solutions are large in size. To download them, open the file "downloadable-solutions-link.pdf" for link to each solution and a provided summary table.
